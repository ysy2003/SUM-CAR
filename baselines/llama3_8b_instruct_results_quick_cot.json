        "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
        "prediction": " Janet starts with 16 eggs. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then she bakes 4 muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, so she makes 9 x $2 = $18.\n\n#### 18\n\nThis is the correct answer. Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. I hope this helps!

        "question": "James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?",
        "prediction": " James runs 3 sprints a week.  Each sprint is 60 meters.  So he runs 3 x 60 = 180 meters a day.  Since he does this 3 times a week, he runs 180 x 3 = 540 meters a week.\n\nSo, James runs 540 meters a week.  That's the answer.  I hope it is correct.  Let me know if you have any questions.

        "question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
        "prediction": " Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning. Then she gives them 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. So, in total, she has given them 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. She needs to give them 3 cups of feed each, so she needs to give them 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed in total. So, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 20. I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll be happy to help.
